# Sentiment-Analysis-IBM-Watson-Alchemy-API
IBM Watson is famous for its cognitive services, which provides us a new way to do text mining. Watson is good at natural language processing and is able to return sentiment scores directly, saving us the efforts of counting positive/negative words and calculating scores. Some R packages, such as “cognizer” and “WatsonR” are released on GitHub to bring the power of Watson to R environment.

This repository contains the code that builds a bridge between Watson and R, and perform sentimental analysis using IBM Watson’s Alchemy API
